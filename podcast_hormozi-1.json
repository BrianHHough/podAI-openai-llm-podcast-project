I hope you've enjoyed this journey with me. I can tell you that this took me over 2,000 hours of work to put together over two years. My editor put another 1,500 hours into the book. So you have two grown men who spent almost two years of their lives or three years of their lives putting this one thing together for you to hopefully serve you in a way that really transforms your business. I've asked before, but if you've ignored it, then this is my sincere ask. It would mean the world to me if you left this book review on Amazon where new people can find it or if you leave review on this podcast as the very least so more people can find it. And even the tiny action of just saying like, hey, I'm going to send this episode and just send the first one of this book series to a friend. I think it could change someone else's life and it would introduce more people to this content. I made it free so that there wouldn't be a barrier for anyone who's in a hard spot. And so that's my ask. Hope you enjoy. Section five, get started. It's not the end. It's not even the beginning of the end, but it is perhaps the end of the beginning. Winston Churchill. June 2017. Three months after we lost it all again and switched gym launch to licensing. Hey, Layla, what do you make of this? I asked. What's up? I gave her my phone. Mr. And Mrs. Hormozi, we cordially invite you to a private event for entrepreneurs earning eight figures and up. Let me know if you're interested. Seems cool, she said. But we're not making eight figures. I pretended not to hear. You want to go? Sure. Is it included in our mentorship dues? One sec. I'll ask. An email response came a moment later. No, this is an additional fee. It's a two day event limited to 10 people at a private resort. Nope. I said. Can we afford to go? Ouch. Who cares? We can't afford not to go. Ten days, a long flight, and a short drive later. We made it. The cool kids meet up. I had one goal, to add as much value as I could to everyone else in the room. But the moment I walked in, I knew I was out of my league. I recognized almost everyone there. They were famous in the advertising world. They all spoke at huge events, signed autographs, made millions, and then there was me. I wasn't an eight figure entrepreneur. I was a kid from Baltimore just paying to breathe everyone else's air. Once everyone settled, we had a short housekeeping discussion and then got down to business. This way of doing things was a sharp contrast to the big stages, booming sound systems, flashing lights, and other theatrics that quote real events have. The first speaker was ready to go. He had a man bun and loose yoga-ish clothing. He looked like a hippie. But then he opened with how he was doing only three million per month. Is this real? I felt like a fraud. The numbers he shared with such a casual attitude blew my mind. How is this possible? He continued on with his talk using all sorts of business, advertising, and tech jargon. He pointed to dizzying charts and graphs. I came here to learn more about advertising, but felt dumber by the second. I recognized enough of the words to realize I knew nothing useful about them. His presentation was way over my head. I started sweating bullets. Layla grabbed my hand. We both felt stressed and out of our depths. He finished and finally opened up for Q&A. Excellent. But the questions were still at the same level as his presentation. Nope. I'm still doomed. Then an awkward voice cracked. So what courses are you taking to learn all this stuff? Now we're talking. I leaned in, pen in hand. His answer changed my life. At this point, I don't expect to learn anything new from courses. I have to learn by doing. And I do by spending a percentage of my revenue to test new campaigns, new channels, new pages, or just plain crazy ideas. And I learn something every time I test, so the money is well spent. Whenever one of these tests is a winner, and some are, it's a big deal. I learn something amazing and make far more money than I spent. It raises the bar for my business and more importantly, myself. So whether it's 1%, 5%, or 10%, set some percentage of your advertising budget aside to try new things without expecting a return. Consider it an investment in your education. I felt chills go through me like some judgment demon left my body. He gave me permission to fail. None of this is magic. If he can do this, so can I. The next week, I tripled my advertising budget. Yes, it was a bit aggressive, but my mindset had completely changed. I'd either make more or get better. Our business went from 400,000 in June to 780,000 in July. From there, my cost to get customers went up too high. So I tried new audiences. Most failed. Then a hit. Boom, we cruised past a million to 1.2 million to 1.5 million per month. Then I realized we didn't follow up with our engaged leads at all. We tested email. Didn't work. We tested phone calls. Nothing. Then I tested text blacks. Wham, we zoomed to 1.8 million the next month. From there, we tested paid ads like crazy. We made way more of them and put more focus on their production value. Boom, we cruised past 2.5 million per month. Then we launched our affiliate program and stacked another 1.5 million per month on top. That took us past 4 million per month. Years later, our portfolio now does more than 16 million per month. So test until you find something that works. Take massive action. Stay focused. Double down on it until it breaks. Then test until you find the next thing that works. And double down on that. Taking these leaps are the only way to unlock the business you want and the life that comes with it. And maybe, slay your judgment demon too. So from now on, you either win or you learn. The end of the beginning. Your speed to making big money depends on how fast you learn the skills to making big money. Getting more engaged leads with the skill of advertising is a great start to making more money. In fact, if you make any amount of money, more engaged leads will make you even more. And sadly, those skills take time to learn. So I share my experiences to shave years off your time. To shorten the gap between no money and no money. It's time to make it happen. Outline of the get started section. This final section has three chapters. They are short and sweet like our time together. In the first chapter, advertising in real life, I lay out my one big advertising rule. Then I'll give you my personal one page advertising plan you can use to get more engaged leads today. In the next chapter, putting it all together, I'll lay out the roadmap to scale from your first few leads all the way to your hundred million dollar leads machine. Finally, a decade in a page, I'll distill everything we learn into bullets to show how far we've come in our time together. Then to send you on your way, I'll share a parable that has gotten me through even my hardest times. Advertising in real life, open to goal. If some is good, more is better. June 2014. When I launched my first gym, I used the same paid ads I used at Sam's gym from way back and they worked for a while. Over time, the cost started creeping up. I got less leads for the same money, but I still needed more customers. I wasn't sure what to do. I talked to a mentor who ran a chain of tanning salons for some advice. He said, before all this fancy internet stuff, flyers crushed for us. You should try those. So try them. We did. We printed over 300. Over the next day, we put them on cars in areas close to the gym. A day passed. Nothing. The next day, the phone rang. Finally. Hey, you put a flyer in my car. My heart raced. It worked. Yes. Yeah, I did. How can I? But before I could finish, he interrupted right back. Yeah, you scratched my Mercedes. Crap. You're going to need to pay for it. I panicked and hung up the phone. He called back. I let it ring. He never called again. That was the only call I got from the flyers. No leads. Nothing. Universe One. Alex, zero. A few weeks later, I sat in the lobby of my gym waiting for customers to fall into my lap. Feeling bored and a bit frustrated, I called the mentor with the quote bright idea to put out the flyers. Hey, Alex, how's it going? Uh, not too good. Why? What's up? We put out the flyers like you said. Oh, yeah? How many leads you get from them? None. That's odd. What was your test size? What do you mean? You know, how many did you put out? I put out 300, I said in a resentful tone. Shoot, you only put out 300? Hard to know if anything works with such a small number. I test with 5,000. Then when we find a winner, we put out 5,000 per day every day for a month. 5,000? He tests with almost 17 times more than my entire quote campaign and he does it in a single day? I felt like the person who says exercise doesn't work after going to the gym one time. And I hate that person. I mean, what kind of response did you think you were going to get? He chuckled. If we get half a percent, that's decent. If we get one percent, that's a winner. With 300 flyers, half a percent would be like one and a half people. That makes it pretty hard to know if you got a winner or not. I had nothing to say. He was right. I felt like a fool. I doubt he remembers the call, but it stuck with me. I promised myself I would never let effort be the reason anything didn't work for me. It could be something else. The offer, the copy, the image, the targeting, the media, the platform, the position of the moon, but not my effort. Those 300 measly flyers taught me a mondo lesson. I did the right stuff, but I didn't do it enough times. I lacked what can be described in a single word, volume. Neil Strauss once said, success comes down to doing the obvious thing for an uncommonly long period of time without convincing yourself you're smarter than you are. The right action in the wrong amount still fails. Most people, myself included, stop too soon. We don't do enough. Most people dramatically underestimate the volume it takes to make advertising work. They're not doing half as much or a third as much as is required. In fact, they're doing dramatically less. I was doing one-fifteen-hundredth the level of effort required to make a flyer campaign work. I just didn't know it. I hear this all the time. Alex, I reached out to 100 people over the last six weeks. I only got one customer. It doesn't work. My response, you did one-forty-second the amount of work required. It was 100 per day, not 100 over time. Most people do not get that advertising is an inputs and outputs game. To them, outputs appear out of their control. Their low effort inputs get them their low and unreliable output of engaged leads. We're ending that now. You input advertising effort. Your output is engaged leads, period. Now we are crystal clear on the stuff you do, the core four, and like we learned, maximizing the core four, you just got to put in more and do it better than before. We started with the rule of 100, but when you make that the norm, you're ready to take it to the next level with the rule of 100 on steroids, open to goal. A very successful gym chain allowed their sales managers to make their own schedules, but there was a catch. They had to sign up five new members per day no matter what. So if they did it by lunch, they could cut out early, but if it took 18 hours, so be it. They called this type of work schedule open to goal. I found that elite entrepreneurs and salespeople across industries do some variation of open to goal. This is because it's like the rule of 100, but for the big kids. You don't just commit to doing something a specific number of times. You commit to the work until you hit a specific number of outcomes, no matter what. So it means you unlock a whole new level of effort you never even realized you had. It might mean only doing something 50 times to get the desired result, or like the flyers, 5,000 times every day for years. If you want to take your advertising to the next level, work until the job is done. Give up the idea of, quote, doing your best. Instead, do what is required. Sometimes that means your best just needs to get better. How I make open to goal work for myself. If I had to pick three habits that best serve me in my life, they would be, number one, waking up early, 4 to 5 a.m. Pro tip, this actually means going to bed early. Two, getting right to work. No rituals, no routines. I drink coffee and get to work. Three, no meetings until noon. No interruptions, nothing, fully focused work time. To be clear, I don't think there's any magic about waking up early, but I do think there's magic in a long stretch of uninterrupted work immediately after a long stretch of uninterrupted sleep. After all, it's the most productive hours in a row of the most productive work I can do, with nothing getting in my way, every single day. How can you lose? And since I have a good idea of what I can do in a day, I set my daily goal accordingly. Then, only after my dedicated block of work do I put out fires, talk to humans, and deal with other day-to-day stuff. Waking up early, getting right to work, and working eight hours straight has been my highest ROI quote habit stack by a long shot. If you choose to try it, I hope it serves you as well as it served me, or better. And for those of you thinking, wait, that's more than 12 hours of work a day. You're right, I'm playing to win. But if it overwhelms you at first, I get it. Just throw it all back a few hours and work your way up. Some days it's tough, but I always like to remind myself, do more than they do, and you will have more than they have. Whenever I get to a low point where I think, why do I even bother? I just try to remind myself, this is where most people stop, and this is why they don't win. Since my job is usually to get more customers in most of my companies, advertising is what I focus on. This book, for example, was written exclusively in that open to goal time block. Why? Because it's an asset that can bring me more companies. So, if you're going to follow my high ROI habit stack, then you're going to want a clear action plan for that time. This is the simplest advertising plan I can give you. One page advertising checklist. Step one, pick the type of engaged leads to get. Customers, affiliates, employees, or agencies. Step two, pick rule of 100 or open to goal. Commit to your daily advertising actions. Step three, fill out the advertising checklist for that daily action. Who? You. What? Your offer or lead magnet. Where? The platform. To whom? Your audience or list. When? Your first eight hours every day. Why? Get X engaged leads or lead getters. How? Warm or cold outreach, content or ads. How much? 100 or until you hit your goal. How many? The number of follow-ups and times retargeted. For how long? 100 days or until you hit your goal. Step four, do this daily action until you have enough money to afford paying someone else to do it. Step five, when you do, go back to step one. Make employees your new target lead type and then repeat steps one through four until you have the help you need. Then scale again. Conclusion. Lots of pages, so many ideas, we're almost at the end, but you don't have any more leads. What gives? Answer. Advertising doesn't get people interested in the stuff you sell. Advertising does. If you're not telling one about the stuff you sell, then you aren't getting anyone interested in your stuff. Period. This chapter laid out the plan to advertise in the simplest way I could. Work open to goal, structure your day to make open to goal possible, create and commit to that goal with the one page advertising checklist. Many skip planning or worse, they write a 100 page plan that never gets used. So skip the atrocious waste of time that is writing pages of baloney. Harness the power of laying out your action steps in a single page. Nobody leaves little room for excuses, distractions or delusions. You either did the stuff or you didn't. You can fill out your one page advertising checklist in about five minutes. And once the naked truth stares back at you, all you have left is to do it. I have a free training that'll help you support the open to goal and rule of 100 checklist so you can print it out and fill it out for yourself and execute it on a daily basis. If you want that, go to acquisition.com forward slash training forward slash leads. Hey, I hope you're enjoying the book chapter that you're listening to right now of $100 million leads. I took a long time putting it together for you. And so my only ask is that you just take a quick second and leave a review for the book on Amazon. It's the number one way that people find books. And this is a way of getting more people into our world. And so our mission at acquisition.com is to make real business education accessible to everyone and I need your help. And so if you could do that just that one small action and it has a trade for the two years that I took putting this book together for you, it would mean the world to me. So thank you. The roadmap, putting it all together, zero to 100 million. A leader must aim high, see big, judge widely, thus setting himself apart from ordinary people who debate in narrow confines. Charles de Gaulle, French president during World War II. To get where you want to go, it pays to know what lies ahead. So in this chapter, I describe the phases you will go through as you scale your advertising. Acquisition.com uses this roadmap to scale our portfolio companies from a few million a year all the way to 100 million plus. These levels will help you identify where you are on the advertising totem pole so you know what to do to get to the next level. Level one, your friends know about the stuff you sell. To start getting engaged leads, you make one offer to one avatar on one platform. The moment you get engaged leads is the moment you can start making money. For me, this started when I started reaching out to everyone I knew. Primary action, warm outreach. Level two, you consistently let everyone you know about the stuff you sell. You know the exact inputs to get an engaged lead with your chosen advertising method. And by scaling those inputs, you get consistent customers with it. But the consistent customers come from maximizing your personal work capacity. For me, on top of warm reach outs, I maximize my personal work capacity with paid ads using a case study as my lead magnet. But looking back, I wish I would have started posting free content. So I suggest that. Primary actions, do as much warm outreach and post as much content as you can. Consistently. Level three, you get employees to help you do more advertising. You've maxed out your personal advertising inputs, but not the platform. And if you want more engaged leads, that can only mean one thing, doing more. For me, I hired a videographer and a media buyer to take most of the paid ads work off my plate. Primary action, you hire people to advertise profitably on your behalf. Level four, your product is good enough to get consistent referrals. You continue building goodwill and shoot for getting 25% or more of your customers from referrals. Now you've set yourself up to ramp your advertising again. But to make that work, you have to get more serious about hiring a team to make it happen. This is when I realized that my ads were shut off, but I was still getting referrals every week. So I doubled down on referrals. I built goodwill using customer feedback to update my product every two weeks. I also started a strong referral program with big incentives at the same time. Primary action, focus on your product until you get consistent referrals, then go back to scaling your advertising with a bigger team. This is where most people mess up. They let their products slip and never recover. Level five, you advertise in more places in more ways with more people. First, you expand to new audiences on your best platform. Then you make ads with all placements and media types the platform supports. And after your team can get consistent results, you expand your team again to add another platform, Leadgetter or Core4 activity. For me, I hit two birds with one stone. I expanded my paid ads to include potential affiliates and this paved the way for my affiliate programs. Primary action, advertise profitably using at least two methods on multiple platforms. Level six, you hire killers. Your executives grow departments specific to an advertising method or a platform without you. And you're not looking for potential. You're looking for experienced leaders specializing in exactly what you want. We capped here. It took me three years to figure out two things. One, that I needed veteran executives with experience suited to my problems. And two, that they needed stronger incentives. But by the time I realized this, I sold those companies. Once I started acquisition.com, I realized the power of expanding the pie to get more of the right people invested in winning. This is how we crossed 100 million plus, then 200 million plus in portfolio revenue and beyond. Primary action, get battle-hardened executives and department heads to take over new advertising activities and channels. Pro tip, hire experience, not potential. I tried cold reach outs twice before it worked the third time. The main reason, the person I hired to run it. First, I tried someone external with experience, that failed. Then I tried internally with no experience, that failed. And finally, I tried internally with experience, that worked. Since it's a people heavy, operationally complex machine, the person you hired to manage the team matters a lot. Pick experience. They should know more than you do. If you're not learning from them in the interview, you've got the wrong person. Level seven, I'll come back and edit this chapter once I cross a billion, I promise. I'll send the lessons as soon as I have them. You have my word. Last points, I know this looks clean, but it never is. Real business is messy. It takes a lot to find out what audiences lead magnets method and platforms work best. And you can only find out what works if you try. So you have to try a lot of different things, a lot of different ways for a long enough time to know for sure. Nobody can ever know the absolute best thing to do. But I do know this. The more you advertise, the more people will find out about the stuff you sell. The more people who know about the stuff you sell, the more people who buy it. This is the key to the $100 million leads machine. The $100 million leads machine. Let's look into your future. Your business makes $100 million plus in annual revenue. It's great to have a clear picture of what $100 million machine looks like. Let's have a look, shall we? First and foremost, your advertising fires in all cylinders. Your media team scales tons of free content and all media types on many platforms. You regularly make offers to your warm audience to get more customers or affiliates. Your ravenous audience makes anything you launch immediately profitable. You have teams running and scaling profitable paid ads across multiple platforms. Your cold to average team gets you more customers. You have an affiliate manager launching and integrating all new affiliates. You have recruiters and recruiting agencies bringing in more lead getters. Your product is so good that a third of your customers bring you more customers. Your executive team drives all this growth without you. And you have more engaged leads than you can possibly handle. How long does this take? For business owners who don't know what to do, anywhere from five to 10 years, building something great, even if you know exactly what to do, takes time. And so many like to trumpet overnight success, but looking behind the curtain tells a different story. It took my wife and I more than 10 years of our best effort to cross up my first $100 million in net worth. So the bigger your goals, the longer time horizons need to be. You want to play games where if you wait, you win. Leadership isn't for the faint of heart. The load is heavy and the road is long. Free gift. Scaling from zero to a hundred million plus. Sometimes it's useful to hear a narrative of what each stage is like. If you know what comes next, you can start preparing for it today. I recorded a free tutorial where I help you identify where you're at, what comes next so you can win faster. You can grab the tutorial free at youguessitacquisition.com forward slash training forward slash leads. A decade in a page. We've covered a lot and I think organizing what we learned in one place helps it sink in. So I made this back of napkin list of what we've covered and why. Number one, how to define a lead from this point forward. Now you know what you're after. Engage leads, not just leads. Two, how to turn leads into engaged leads with an offer lead magnet and how to make them. Three, the core four. The only four ways we can let other people know about the stuff we sell. A, how to reach out to people who know us, ask them if they know anybody. B, how to post publicly, hook, retain, reward, give until they ask. C, how to reach out to strangers, lists, personalization, big fast value, volume. D, how to run paid ads to strangers, targeting, call outs, what, who, whens, CTAs, client finance acquisition. Four, maximizing the core four, more better new. What keeps us from doing what I'm currently doing at 10 times the volume, then solving for that. B, finding the constraint of our advertising, then testing until it frees the constraint, then doing more until it gets constrained again. Five, the four lead getters, customers, employees, agencies, and affiliates. How to get customers to refer other customers, how to get employees to scare your advertising without you, how to get an agency to teach you new skills, how to get affiliates launched and integrated. Six, when advertising in the real world, the rule of 100 and open to goal. The five step one page advertising plan to get more leads today. Seven, the seven levels of advertisers and the $100 million leads machine in action. As I promised in the beginning, the result of these bullets is more, better, cheaper, reliable, engaged leads. I hope this book provides you utility. I hope as a result of reading this, you know how to get more leads than you currently are. And I hope I unmasked the mystery behind lead getting. Also, since you're one of the few actually finished what you start, I want to leave you with a parting gift, a fable that has gotten me through my hardest times. The many sided die. Imagine you and a friend play a dice rolling game. You are each given one die. One of the die has 20 sides. The other has 200. On each die, only one side is green and the rest are red. The point of the game is simple. Roll green as many times as you can. The rules of the game are as follows. You can't see how many sides you have. You can only see if you roll red or green. If you roll green, one of your red sides turns green and you get to roll again. If you roll red, nothing happens and you get to roll again. The game ends when you stop rolling and if you stop rolling, you lose. What do you do? You roll. When you roll red, you pick up the die and roll again. When others roll green, you pick up your die and roll again. When you roll green, you pick up the die and roll again. You keep telling yourself one thing. The more I roll, the more greens I get. At first, you roll green once in a while. But as more red sides turn green, the greens happen more. With enough rolls, hitting green becomes the rule rather than the exception. What does your friend do? He rolls a few times and hits a red each time. He sees you roll a green and complains that you must have a die with fewer sides. He reasons it's the only way you could have rolled green before him. And although you did, you also rolled many more times. So which is it? In either case, he rolls a few more times in frustration and hits a green. But then he complains about how long it took. He spent more time watching you and complaining than actually playing. Meanwhile, you've hit your green streak. It's so much easier for you, he tells himself. You get greens every time. This game is rigged. What's the point? He quits. So who got the die with 20 sides and who got the die with 200 sides? If you get the game, then you see, once you roll enough times, the die you're given doesn't matter. The die with fewer sides might roll green sooner. The die with more sides might roll green later. But a die with a green side always has a chance of rolling green if you roll it. Every die hits its green streak when rolled enough times. All of us get a many sided die. In looking at the other players, you have no idea if it's their hundredth roll or their hundredth thousandth roll. You don't know how good other players are when they start. You can only see how well they do now. But if you understand the game, you also know it doesn't matter. A few begin playing early. Others begin much later. They're rested on the sidelines complaining about how lucky the players are. I guess so. But they're lucky because they play. And when they hit red, which they do, they didn't quit. They rolled again. Learning to advertise is a lot like the game of the many sided die. You do not know if it will work until you try. And when you start advertising, you will probably hit red on your first few rolls. But if you try enough times, you will hit green. And when it works, you have a better chance of getting it to work again. The more you do, the easier it gets. You begin to understand the game. No matter how many players there are, or the number of sides on the die you're given, you start to see there are only two guarantees. One, the more times you roll, the better you get. Two, if you quit, you lose. So here's my final promise. You cannot lose if you do not quit. Free goodies, call to action. If it's free, it's for me. I'm going to give you a bunch of free stuff in a second, so stay tuned. Dr. Akashi, my editor and I, spent over 3,500 hours on this book. We wrote 650 plus pages and 19 drafts with varying frames, themes, and focal points. But ultimately, the changes left only the most distilled, need-to-knows inside. We went through 127 pages of hand-drawn models to carve out the few that made it in the book. All that to say, I hope this work results in you growing the business of your dreams. When I look back on my life, these books will be among the things I am most proud of. I wouldn't be able to write as fervently if I didn't think people would read it. And as much as I strive to be the man who would work as hard if nobody cared, I'm not there yet. Your support and positivity make a difference for me. So thank you from the bottom of my heart for allowing me to do the work I find meaningful. I am forever grateful. If you are new to Mosviem Nation, welcome. We believe in big ambitions and matching our ambitions with giving and patience. And I have a personal goal in that spirit of giving, to die with nothing left to give. So if you are still with me, thank you. I want to provide some more free goodies.

It's all available on Amazon.

And so if you want, let me tell you the top five episodes that we've ever had on the podcast and you can start there. Episode 486, Breaking the Poor Mindset, Episode 481, 42 Rules of Money, Episode 496, Conversations That Changed My Life, Episode 482, 100K Per Month with No Employees, and Episode 464, Ways to Make a Million Dollars. All right, so you can go and start any of those if you want to just have the first one. It's episode 486. And if you've been freeloading this whole time and listening to the podcast and you've never shared it and you've never left a review and you didn't, go to Amazon and leave the book review even though you didn't buy the book, you can still leave it a review. Pay it forward. It'll come back to you. Hope you enjoy the rest."}, "podcast_summary": "The final episode of the podcast, \"The Game\" by Alex Hormozi, wraps up the $100 million leads special edition series.

In 2013, he started his first brick & mortar business. Within three years, he successfully scaled his business to six locations. He then sold his locations to transition to the turnaround business. From there he spent two years turning 32+ brick & mortar businesses around using the same model that made his privately owned locations successful.After that experience, he packaged his process into a licensing model which scaled to over 4000+ locations in 4 years. Over that same four-year period, he founded and scaled three other companies to $120M+ in cumulative sales across four different industries (software, service, e-commerce, and brick & mortar) without taking on outside capital. He has scaled and exited 7 companies. His most notable exit was his majority sale of his licensing company for $46.2M in 2021.He transitioned from CEO to the owner/shareholder position in these companies in 2020, and founded Acquisition.com as a way to invest his own wealth (both monetary and intellectual capital) into other businesses.
